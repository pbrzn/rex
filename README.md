# RexMovieRecommendationBot

Sick of endlessly scrolling Netflix, Hulu, or countless other streamers looking for the right movie to watch?
Just ask Rex! Rex is a bot designed to collate the top 30 most popular movies offered by the streaming service of your choice, then give you a recommendation, either from the full list or from the specific genre you wish to explore.

## Usage

Fork and clone this repo. In your terminal, navigate into the newly created directory then type `ruby bin/run` to begin running the application.

First, you will be prompted to name a streaming service of your choice, such as Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, etc.

Once you have typed your choice into the CLI, you will be given be given the choice of either listing the 30 most popular movies on the service, choosing a genre, or get a recommendation right off the bat.

Once you have made your choice you will either receive your recommendation or be given prompts to facilitate your recommendation. When you receive your recommendation you will be asked whether you would like another recommendation, start fresh with a different streaming service, or end the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
